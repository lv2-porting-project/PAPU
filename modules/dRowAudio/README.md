# A JUCE module for high level audio application development.

dRowAudio is a 3rd party JUCE module designed for rapid audio application development. It contains classes for audio processing and GUI elements.

Additionally, there are several wrappers around 3rd party libraries including:
* [cURL](https://github.com/bagder/curl)
* [FFTReal](http://ldesoras.free.fr/prod.html)
* [SoundTouch](http://www.surina.net/soundtouch/index.html)

dRowAudio is written following JUCE's [Coding Standard](http://www.juce.com/learn/coding-standards).

This library is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/m-rest/drowaudio).
Please find the online documentation [here](http://drowaudio.co.uk/docs/).
